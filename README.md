# AutoIV

In the summer of 2023, under the supervision of Professor Russel Steele, I conducted a research project that aimed to replicate the results of Yuan et al. (2022). 

The repository includes the following:

1. A Python file named "Updated_Code.py" contains the results of updating the code from the original paper updated to the newest version of tensor flow. With this file, one can synthesize the IVs using the algorithm introduced by Yuan et al (2022). 

2. A Python file called "Analysis.py" where I conduct experiments to test the efficacy of the generated IVs. I also generate tables that summarize the mean and standard error of the MSEs of each experiment.

3. A PDF file called "Report.pdf" describes the process I followed during my project. In addition, this document provides some discussion on the results and limitations of the project.

You can find the notes I took from a textbook called "What If" where I learned the basics of causal inference and instrumental variables in the link below.
